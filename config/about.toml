I'm a trainee software developer, from Colombia, I'm studying Dart and flutter and in web development, I'm taking the route to be a backend. I enjoy solving complex problems.

My job is to build websites and mobile applications so that it is functional and easy to use, but at the same time attractive. In addition, I give it a personal touch and make sure my work is eye-catching and user-friendly. My goal, apart from being functional, is to provide an excellent user experience.
